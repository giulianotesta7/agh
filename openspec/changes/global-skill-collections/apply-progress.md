## PR 1B.2 Post-Verify Review Fixes

Reliability blocker and contract warning fixes applied after formal verify passed.

### Fixes Applied

- `update_collection_package()` now revalidates the effective package/version for skill-only compliance whenever the assignment will remain/become active, even when `package_ref` is not supplied in the PATCH payload. This prevents a stored `@latest` assignment from being successfully patched (e.g., `position` or `active: true`) after `latest` drifts to an instruction-bearing package.
- `GET /skills:resolve` now accepts either the stored requested ref (e.g., `acme/tool@latest`) or the concrete resolved ref returned by `GET /skills` (e.g., `acme/tool@1.2.0`), while still requiring the resolved package to be collection-authorized and skill-only.
- `_validate_skill_only_package()` accepts an optional pre-resolved `version_row` to avoid redundant version resolution in `list_skills()` and `resolve_skill()`.

### Tests Added

- `test_patch_rejects_active_assignment_when_latest_resolves_to_instruction_package`
- `test_skills_resolve_accepts_concrete_ref_from_skills_list`

### Verification After Fixes

- `uv run pytest tests/test_collection_package_assignments.py -q` → 16 passed.
- `uv run pytest -q` → 386 passed, 1 skipped.
- `uv run ruff format agh/server/routes/collections.py tests/test_collection_package_assignments.py` → 2 files reformatted.
- `uv run ruff check agh/server/routes/collections.py tests/test_collection_package_assignments.py` → All checks passed.

## PR 1B.2 Final Review Fixes

- Added warning-level logging when `GET /skills` suppresses an active assignment because the resolved package is no longer skill-only.
- Hardened collection filter assertions to prove non-empty/cardinality behavior.
- Added an isolated inactive-collection resolve test where the assignment remains active.
- Removed dead parsing variables from the package publishing test helper.

### Final Verification

- `uv run pytest tests/test_collection_package_assignments.py -q` → 18 passed.
- `uv run pytest -q` → 388 passed, 1 skipped.
- `uv run ruff format agh/server/routes/collections.py tests/test_collection_package_assignments.py` → clean.
